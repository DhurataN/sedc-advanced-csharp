# Homework 1 - Parking

Fully implement the class given as a stub in `Parking.cs`.

## Features

1. The class will have to be generic, to model parkings for different vehicles
2. The class will have a constructor that gets as parameter the capacity of the parking.
3. The capacity of the parking is not modificable once the parking is constructed
4. The class will have two methods to park and unpark a car.
5. The `Park` method takes a vehicle, and parks it (updating internal state)
6. The `LeaveParking` method takes no parameters, and returns a vehicle (according to some internal logic) and updates internal state
7. The `Capacity` property should allow to get the total capacity of the parking
8. The `OccupiedPlaces` property should allow to get the occupied parking places. This property is modifiable, but the value must be controlled.
9. The `FreePlaces` property should allow to get the free parking places. This property is modifiable, but the value must be controlled.
